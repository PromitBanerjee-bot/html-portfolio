<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>This is such a masterpiece by Makoto Shinkai.</p>

<h3>Graveyard of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>I really like this movie because it shows the life of a teenage boy in Japan during the World wars.</p>

<h3>I want to eat your pancreas</h3>
<p>First of all this movie is very depressing showing us the life of a girl Sakura who is struck by a deadly pancreatic disease.</p>
